<h1>A-Maze-d</h1>

<p>
A-MAZE-D is a maze-solving project written in C, where your goal is to guide multiple robots from the entrance to the exit of a labyrinth as efficiently as possible. The program reads a maze description from standard input and calculates optimal paths for the robots using graph algorithms. It ensures no collisions between robots and outputs each step of their movement until all reach the end. This project emphasizes graph theory, pathfinding, and strategic movement within constraints.
